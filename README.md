### Result

The app is a nerd version of the ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR Game of choosing one out of three, but now it is five, and it was a reference for the series show [The Big Bang Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSHPVCBsnLw) was developed using only react and tailwind CSS in precisely three days. It has some cool CSS effects and all the required BONUS features for this test, except I, did not test it.
